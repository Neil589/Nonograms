# Nonograms
A nonograms project in Java for Comp 301.
Nonograms are puzzles which originate from Japan in which the player is presented with a 2d grid and clues for each row and column
as to how many shaded cells there are in the given row and column. 
For example, a row which has a clue of 2 has 2 shaded cells somewhere in that row and it is your job to find out where they are positioned.

The player is provided with a UI which is quite simple to use in which a left click shades a cell and a right click eliminates a cell. 
Double clicking a shaded/elilminated cell resets it to empty. 
Once all the correct cells are shaded a sucess message is displayed to show that you have won. 
There are also buttons to clear the whole board to restart, go to the next puzzle, go to the previous puzzle, and go to a random puzzle in the puzzle library.
In the current puzzle library there are 5 different puzzles you can choose from however you can also add more or remove puzzles if you wish to. 
Readme_301.md contains more instructions and details about the project.

The link below contains some images of the UI and the working of it!
